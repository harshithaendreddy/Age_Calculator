**Overview**
This project is a simple web-based Age Calculator that allows users to input their birthdate and calculates the following:

Age in years, months, and days
Total months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds passed since the birthdate

The application uses a form-based user interface for input and displays the results dynamically on the same page. It leverages JavaScript to perform date calculations and update the results.

**Features**
Responsive design using CSS with a gradient background.
Calculates age based on the user-provided birthdate.
Outputs multiple metrics: years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Displays results within a container styled for easy readability.

**How It Works**
Form Submission: The user inputs their birthdate in the format DD-MM-YYYY.
Validation: The script checks the input to ensure a valid date is provided. If the date is invalid, an alert is shown.
Calculation: The JavaScript function calculateAge() calculates the age and other time metrics (e.g., weeks, days) based on the current date and the input birthdate.
Displaying Results: The results are dynamically injected into a hidden container, which becomes visible once the calculations are done.
